      "11: I see where you’re coming from, and I like the idea in theory, but I always wonder how much we can actually trust the government to roll it out fairly and efficiently. Sometimes their “oversight” ends up turning into a mess or gets caught up in politics.\n",
      "9: Honestly, I do get that concern—it’s fair to worry about how smoothly something new would go, especially with the government involved. But if we set it up with good oversight and transparency right from the start, I think UBI could really help a lot of people, especially as jobs change with automation.\n",

    "This is the modern and flexible way to handle interventions, inject new information, or (in the future) trigger other types of changes.\n",

    "An \"event\" is a dictionary with three key properties:\n",
    "- `round`: The round number on which the event should trigger.\n",
    "- `type`: The kind of event to execute. We'll demonstrate two key types:\n",
    "    - `intervention`: The classic intervention, where a specific message is given to a set of agents.\n",
    "    - `information_injection`: A powerful new event that introduces a *new* piece of information to a subset of the network.\n",
    "- `...other_params`: Additional parameters depending on the event type, such as `nodes`, `content`, `seed_score`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's design a scenario:\n",
    "- **Round 4**: An official health organization (an `intervention`) tries to promote the benefits of a new dietary supplement.\n",
    "- **Round 8**: A conspiracy theory blog (an `information_injection`) starts spreading a rumor that the supplement is harmful.\n"

    "## 5. Dynamic Networks: Bringing Your Simulation to Life\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most advanced features of `llm-society`. So far, the network structure (who is connected to whom) has been static. With **Dynamic Networks**, the social fabric itself evolves based on the agents' conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When `dynamic_network` is enabled, we empower the LLM to act as a social judge. After every conversation, the LLM not only scores the agents' beliefs but also provides a **new tie strength** for their relationship, based on their original connection and the quality of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to two powerful emergent behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Link Formation**: If two previously unconnected agents have a positive conversation, a new link can form between them, creating a new social connection.\n",
    "- **Link Severing**: If two connected agents have a very negative or conflict-ridden conversation, their tie strength can drop so low that their link is severed entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling Dynamic Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this feature, you need to set three key parameters:\n",
    "1.  `dynamic_network=True`: The master switch to turn the feature on.\n",
    "2.  `conversation_scope=\"all\"`: This is **required** because it allows conversations to happen between any pair of agents, not just already connected ones, which is necessary for new links to form.\n",
    "3.  `link_formation_threshold` / `link_sever_threshold`: The thresholds that determine when a new link is strong enough to be created, or an old one is weak enough to be destroyed.\n"

      "8: Hey, not much, just keeping an eye on how fast tech is moving these days. Feels like there’s always something new to be skeptical about, you know?\n",
      "5: Yeah, totally get that—it’s moving so fast it’s hard to know what to trust anymore. I always feel like there’s some catch or downside that gets glossed over.\n",
      "8: Man, I hear you. It feels like every new tech thing comes with a string nobody talks about until it’s too late.\n",
      "5: Exactly, it's like there's always a catch they hope you don't notice till you're already locked in. Makes you wonder who they're really building this stuff for.\n",
      "8: Yeah, it always feels like these tech companies are looking out for themselves first. I try to dig into the fine print, but sometimes it feels like a full-time job just to keep up.\n",

      "7: Yeah, I totally agree. I don’t trust big companies or the government to look out for us, so putting too much power in either place seems risky. Giving people more tools and choices to protect themselves sounds way better than just piling on more regulations.\n",
